# React Native - Mobile Computing Projects

This repository contains projects built with **React Native** as part of the Mobile Computing course.

### What is React Native?

React Native is an open-source framework created by Meta (Facebook) that lets developers build real native mobile apps for iOS and Android using **JavaScript** and **React**.

Instead of writing separate code in Swift/Objective-C (for iOS) and Kotlin/Java (for Android), you write once in JavaScript → React Native translates your components into true native UI elements. This gives near-native performance while sharing most of the codebase across platforms.

### Why React Native fits Mobile Computing

- Cross-platform development (one code → iOS + Android)
- Fast development cycle with hot-reloading
- Access to device features (camera, GPS, notifications, sensors…)
- Strong ecosystem: Expo, React Navigation, Reanimated, TanStack Query, Firebase/Supabase integration
- Great for learning mobile concepts: state management, navigation, offline support, API handling, animations, permissions, and native modules

All projects here focus on applying mobile computing principles using modern React Native practices.

Happy coding!
